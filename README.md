# Project Atlas
## Atlas backend service

This is the first step towrads building an alternative cloud computing platform. It's supposed to be anti-AWS. This application would be built upon the thesis of considering cloud computing as a utility company akin to an electricity utility co. aims to provide reliable computing capacity at scale at a marginal cost to the consumers.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with `models`, `routes`, and `database` layers.
- **Scalability**: Prepared for adding features like services, repositories, and middleware.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified setup for rapid development.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.19 or higher.
- **Database**: Configure your database in `database/database.go`.

## Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prajna1999/atlas-be.git
   cd atlas-be
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Update database configuration:
   Modify the database settings in `internal/database/database.go` to match your environment.

4. Run the application:
